Hello, my name is Matt. I'm a staff software engineer with experience leading infrastructure and product teams.

### Experience

I'm currently a software engineer working at [gretel.ai](https://gretel.ai/), a privacy AI company focused on creating synthetic data.

Previously, I was an infra/platform SWE working on the Developer Experience team at Lyft.
We worked with our sibling infra teams to ensure our product engineers could be as efficient and safe as possible before pushing to production.
You can read more about our work in our [blog series](https://eng.lyft.com/scaling-productivity-on-microservices-at-lyft-part-3-extending-our-envoy-mesh-with-staging-fdaafafca82f), or watch my presentation from _EnvoyCon 2022_ ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9dYr23MVv0), [abstract](https://envoyconna22.sched.com/event/1AO5k), [slides](assets/envoycon2022.pdf))

While at Lyft, I also worked on our observability team (tracing, logging, metrics, dashboards) and a product team called [Express Drive](https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive).

I've also had internships at Facebook (iOS), Google (Unified Notifications), and Etsy (Promoted Listings).

### Education
After high school in LA, I attended the University of Michigan for a BSE in Computer Science.

While studying at Michigan, I was involved with the [Solar Car Team](https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu), [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.umich.edu), and TAing for [EECS 485 (Web Systems)](https://eecs485staff.github.io/eecs485.org).
