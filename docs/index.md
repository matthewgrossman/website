Hello, my name is Matt. I'm a staff software engineer with experience leading infrastructure and product teams.

### Experience
Currently, I'm an infra/platform SWE working on the Developer Environments team at Lyft.
We work with our sibling infra teams to ensure our product engineers can be as efficient and safe as possible before pushing to production.
You can read more about our work in our [blog series](https://eng.lyft.com/scaling-productivity-on-microservices-at-lyft-part-3-extending-our-envoy-mesh-with-staging-fdaafafca82f), or watch my presentation from _envoycon 2022_ ([recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9dYr23MVv0), [abstract](https://envoyconna22.sched.com/event/1AO5k), [slides](assets/envoycon2022.pdf))

Lately I've been expanding into the observability space, and working on ways we can improve our tracing, logging, metrics, and dashboard systems.

Earlier at Lyft, I was a product SWE working on the [Express Drive](https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive) team.
I've also had internships at Facebook (iOS), Google (Unified Notifications), and Etsy (Promoted Listings).

### Education
After high school in LA, I attended the University of Michigan for a BSE in Computer Science.

While studying at Michigan, I was involved with the [Solar Car Team](https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu), [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.umich.edu), and TAing for [EECS 485 (Web Systems)](https://eecs485staff.github.io/eecs485.org).
