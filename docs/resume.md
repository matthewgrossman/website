## Employment


### **Tech Lead, Developer Environments** @ [Lyft](https://lyft.com) *(2020 - Current)*

> *Developer Environments* is a platform team focused on creating infrastucture and tooling to safely accelerate developer productivity.

Set up a team for success via direct mentorship, creating/aligning on a multi-year vision/roadmap, and negotiating projects with x-team stakeholders (networking/deploys/obs/security). 
Represented team in 15+ presentations as I evangelized our dev product across the company.



#### <u>E2E Testing Environment</u>
* Led a multi-year effort to deprecate our existing E2E testing solution in favor of a more
cost-efficient and productive dev environment. Rather than giving each dev their own
expensive EC2, we leverage our shared staging environment and dynamic routing to
enable request-level isolation. 
* **Impact**: Reduced infra spend by $170k/mo and lowered maintenance costs for all of infra.
* **Technologies**: envoy, docker, kubernetes,

Architected and led many customer-facing projects, working with data science, design, product, and operations to launch features.

#### <u>Volume-Based Pricing Lead</u>

* To ensure insurance costs were attributed to high-mileage drivers, we created rentals plans that charged per-mile.
I was the primary technical POC for integration efforts, ensuring multiple work streams (mobile, backend, frontend; 10+ eng) all were unblocked and convened for an on-time launch.
* Led the creation of a high QPS service that subscribed to our fleet's telemetry events, and segmented miles driven in-app versus off-app.

**Technologies**: python, flask, javascript, protobufs, dynamodb, redis, EC2


#### <u>Oncall toil reduction</u>
