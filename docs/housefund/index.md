# New House Fund!

![housepic](../assets/house.jpg){: .full-width }

We're hoping to buy a house sometime in the near future.
Any amount you're able to contribute is greatly appreciated!


# How to send funds:

## Venmo
`venmo` is the easiest (and cheapest) way for us to receive your gift.

You can send funds to Rachel's account:
[venmo.com/rachelgoldberg94](https://venmo.com/rachelgoldberg94)

If you are viewing this on your computer, you can scan this QR with your phone:

## Check/Cash
While we'd prefer to receive funds via `venmo`, we'll appreciate a contribution in any form! We'll have a gift-card table on the wedding day if you'd prefer a physical gift.
