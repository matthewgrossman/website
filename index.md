Hello, my name is Matt. I'm a senior backend software engineer working in San Francisco.

### Experience
Currently, I'm an infra SWE working on the Developer Experience (devx) team at Lyft. We work with our sibling infra teams to ensure our product engineers can be as efficient and safe as possible before pushing to production.

Previously, I was a product SWE working on the [Express Drive](https://www.lyft.com/expressdrive) team at Lyft.
I've also had internships at Facebook (iOS), Google (Unified Notifications), and Etsy (Promoted Listings).

buzzwords:

* __languages__: python3, c++14, typescript, golang
* __databases__: dynamodb, S3, redis
* __devops__: docker, kubernetes, envoy, ELK, statsd, opentracing

### Education
After high school in LA, I attended the University of Michigan for a BSE in Computer Science.

While studying at Michigan, I was involved with the [Solar Car Team](https://www.solarcar.engin.umich.edu), [Eta Kappa Nu](https://hkn.eecs.umich.edu), and TAing for [EECS 485 (Web Systems)](https://eecs485staff.github.io/eecs485.org).
